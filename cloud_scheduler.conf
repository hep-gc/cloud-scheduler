#
# A sample configuration file for the cloud scheduler.
#

[global]

# cloud_resource_config is the path to the default list of resources you want
#           to use with Cloud Scheduler. If no file is supplied on the command
#           line (-c some_cloud | --cloud-config=some_cloud), this file will
#           be used.
#
cloud_resource_config: /etc/cloudscheduler/cloud_resources.conf 

# condor_retrieval_method is the method by which Cloud Scheduler gets job and 
#           resource data. Cloud Scheduler uses this data to determine how 
#           many VMs to boot for a user's jobs. There are two options: local
#           and soap. The SOAP method uses the Condor SOAP API to retrieve 
#           the data from Condor, and uses the condor_webservice_url and 
#           condor_collector_url options for contacting Condor. The local 
#           method simply runs the equivalent of 'condor_q -l' or
#           'condor_status -l' at the command line. If you like, you can 
#           change the command that Cloud Scheduler runs, for example, if
#           your central manager is on a different machine, you can make the
#           command something like 'ssh condor.your.org condor_status -l'.
#           This depends on the condor_q_command and the condor_status_command
#           options.
#
#           At this time, the soap method is considerably slower than the local
#           method.
#
#           The default is local

#   The default value is http://localhost:8080
condor_webservice_url: http://localhost:8080

#           that use OpenVPN) might need a diferent hostname for the VMs than
#           for Cloud Scheduler.
#

#   The default is true
#graceful_shutdown: true

# gradeful_shutdown_method specifies the way CloudScheduler will shutdown

#           'hold' will use condor_hold & condor_release to handle this - DEPRECATED
#           'off' will use condor_off to peacefully stop the condor startd
#           on the VM. This requires a password-less ssh to be setup from 
#           CloudScheduler to the Condor centeral manager. It is preferable

#           ie 1.5 will ensure there is average_time * 1.5 time remaining until
