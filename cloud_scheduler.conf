#
# A sample configuration file for the cloud scheduler.
#

[global]

# cloud_resource_config is the path to the default list of resources you want
#           to use with Cloud Scheduler. If no file is supplied on the command
#           line (-c some_cloud | --cloud-config=some_cloud), this file will
#           be used.
#
cloud_resource_config: /etc/cloudscheduler/cloud_resources.conf 

# condor_retrieval_method is the method by which Cloud Scheduler gets job and 
#           resource data. Cloud Scheduler uses this data to determine how 
#           many VMs to boot for a user's jobs. There are two options: local
#           and soap. The SOAP method uses the Condor SOAP API to retrieve 
#           the data from Condor, and uses the condor_webservice_url and 
#           condor_collector_url options for contacting Condor. The local 
#           method simply runs the equivalent of 'condor_q -l' or
#           'condor_status -l' at the command line. If you like, you can 
#           change the command that Cloud Scheduler runs, for example, if
#           your central manager is on a different machine, you can make the
#           command something like 'ssh condor.your.org condor_status -l'.
#           This depends on the condor_q_command and the condor_status_command
#           options.
#
#           At this time, the soap method is considerably slower than the local
#           method.
#
#           The default is soap
#
#condor_retrieval_method: soap

# condor_webservice_url must point to the URL of the SOAP service on your
#           Condor pool, and the port on which it is running (usually 8080).
#                       
#   The default value is http://localhost:8080
condor_webservice_url: http://localhost:8080

# condor_collector_url must point to the URL of the SOAP service for your
#           Condor collector, and the port on which it is running (usually 9618).
#                       
#   The default value is http://localhost:9618
condor_collector_url: http://localhost:9618

# condor_q_command this is the command that Cloud Scheduler runs to get Condor
#           job data. If you like, you can change the command that Cloud 
#           Scheduler runs, for example, if your central manager is on a
#           different machine, you can make the command something like 
#           'ssh condor.your.org condor_q -l'.
#
#    The default value is 'condor_q -l'
#condor_q_command: condor_q -l

# condor_status_command this is the command that Cloud Scheduler runs to get Condor
#           machine data. If you like, you can change the command that Cloud 
#           Scheduler runs, for example, if your central manager is on a
#           different machine, you can make the command something like 
#           'ssh condor.your.org condor_status -l'.
#
#    The default value is 'condor_status -l'
#condor_status_command: condor_status -l

# condor_off_command this is the command that Cloud Scheduler runs to manange VMs
#           in the condor pool. If the central manager is on a different machine

#condor_off_command: /usr/sbin/condor_off

# condor_on_command this is the command that Cloud Scheduler runs to manange VMs

# condor_host_on_vm is the hostname of the central manager that the Condor
#           daemons on the VM connect to. This is normally derived from the
#           condor_webservice_url option, but some setups (for example, those
#           that use OpenVPN) might need a diferent hostname for the VMs than
#           for Cloud Scheduler.
#
#   The default value is the hostname from condor_webservice_url. If this value
#   is localhost, it won't be sent to the VM.
#
#condor_host_on_vm: your.condor.server.edu

# condor_context_file is the location on your VM image where cloud_scheduler
#           should write the address of your Condor central manager machine
#           This is required to automatically contextualize your VM to point
#           to your Condor Pool
#                       
#   The default value is nothing, so no contextualization will happen unless
#   a value is specifically placed here
#condor_context_file: /etc/condor/central_manager

# vm_lifetime is the maximum time in minutes that you would like your VMs to
#           live.  Cloud Scheduler may shut them down before this point, but

#vm_lifetime: 10080

# cert_file is the location of the (x509 or other) certificate that you would
#           like copied to your virtual machine. This is useful for setting

#   There is no default.
#cert_file: /your/cert.pem

# key_file is the location of the (x509 or other) key that you would

#   The default value is sdb
#scratch_attach_device: sdb

# info_server_port is the port that the xmlrpc server that serves information
#           to tools like cloud_status uses. You may need to change this
#           to something other than the default if you have a conflict
#           with some other program, but you probably won't need to.
#
#   The default value is 8111

# scheduling_algorithm specifies how Cloud Scheduler will schedule jobs.
#           'fairshare' Attempts to give each user an equal amount of
#           cloud resources to use, and balance resources between users.
#           It includes several options regarding how machines are shutdown,
#           sharing metrics, and support for high priority jobs
#           
#           'fifo' Attempts to schedules jobs based on the order that they come in.

# job_distribution_type specifies how Cloud Scheduler will determine job shares.
#           for 'normal' distribution, a users' jobs will be evalutated based on 
#           priority and jobs of same priority are treated first in, first out.
#           for 'split' distribution, a users' jobs will be evaluated based on
#           priority and jobs of the same priority will get a split of their share
#
#   The default valus is 'normal'
#job_distribution_type: normal

# graceful_shutdown specifies if you want machines to only shutdown when no
#           job is running on them, this requires using condor_hold and 
#           condor_release on jobs and can affect performance, but will
#           prevent a job from being rescheduled due to Cloud_Scheduler
#           shutting down a job's VM once it has started running
#
#   The default is false
#graceful_shutdown: false

# gradeful_shutdown_method specifies the way CloudScheduler will shutdown
#           machines to minimize job interuptions.
#           'hold' will use condor_hold & condor_release to handle this
#           'off' will use condor_off to peacefully stop the condor startd
#           on the VM. This requires a password-less ssh to be setup from 
#           CloudScheduler to the Condor centeral manager. It is preferable
#           to use 'off' if possible.
#   The default is 'hold'
#graceful_shutdown_method: hold

# retire_before_lifetime specifies if you want Cloud Scheduler to attempt to
#           retire VMs before they reach their max vm_lifetime in order to 
#           minimize interrupted jobs caused by the VM being shutdown while a 
#           job is executing.

#   The default value is false

# retire_before_lifetime_factor is amount of buffer CS will give a VM before 
#           retiring when near the max vm_lifetime. 
#           Cloud Scheduler tracks the run time of the last several jobs the VM
#           has run and will apply the factor to the average run time.
#           ie 1.5 will ensure there is average_time * 1.5 time remaining until 
#           vm_lifetime and if not will retire that VM so no more jobs
#           will run on it.
#
#   The default is 1.5 (Must be a float value greater than 1.0)
#retire_before_lifetime_factor: 1.5

# scheduling_metric selects the type of scheduling cloud_scheduler will
# use to balance resources between users.
#    The default value is slot, other option(s) are: memory, memory_cpu, memory_cpu_storage

# scheduler_interval is the number of seconds between VM scheduling cycles.

#   the SIGUSR2 signal (kill -s SIGUSR2 <pid>) to reload the ban information.
#
#   The default value is false
#ban_tracking: false

# ban_file is tha path to the file where banned vm / resources are stored
#   The information is stored in a JSON format that can edited manually or

# until it considers VMs on that cloud invalid and eligable to remove from system.
#
# The default value is 1800 (30 minutes)
#vm_connection_fail_threshold: 1800

# vm_idle_threshold determines how long a VM can remain idle while there are potential idle jobs
# waiting to run on it, this is typically caused by mis-configured job requirements.
# If cloud scheduler determines job is unable to run due to bad +VM* requirements it will shutdown
# the idle VM so new VMs using the idle jobs +VM* parameters can be booted. If cloudscheduler
# is unable to determine why the job is not running (possible due to requirements conflicts) the 
# job will attempt to be held.
