The cloud_scheduler init script is a sysinit V init script for typical
RHEL OS to be placed in /etc/init.d. 
It goes with the cloud_scheduler.sysconfig configuration file to be
placed in /etc/sysconfig/cloud_scheduler.
With these two, the modified condor init script should not be needed.

In the worker:
   1. copy cloud_scheduler to /etc/init.d/cloud_scheduler
   2. copy cloud_scheduler.sysconfig to /etc/sysconfig/cloud_scheduler
   3. /sbin/chkconfig --add cloud_scheduler
